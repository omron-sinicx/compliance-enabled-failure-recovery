3. Configure your remote repository:

```bash
git remote add origin your-repo-url
git push origin project-page
```

> [!NOTE]
> The implementation of the paper is published in the main branch, and the code for the project page is expected to be pushed to a separate branch.
> If you want to change the branch settings, please modify `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`.

🚨 TroubleShooting

<details>
<summary>Branch "project-page" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules</summary>
Navigate to Settings > Environments > github-pages > 🗑️
or set rules properly (add `project-page` to deployable branch).

## 🐶 Husky & Typo Checking

### Automatic Typo Checking

This project uses Husky to automatically check for typos during commits. The check is performed using the `typos` tool and only runs on staged files (files that have been `git add`ed).
If you want to ignore specific typos as a dictionary, please add the original and corrected versions to `_typos.toml`. ([doc](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#false-positives))


```bash
[default.extend-words]
# Don't correct the surname "Teh"
teh = "teh"
```

### Manual Typo Checking

To manually check for typos without committing:

```bash
npx typos
```

This command checks all files in the project, regardless of whether they are staged for commit or not.

### Disabling Git Hooks

To temporarily disable all git hooks (including lint, format, and typo validation) during commit:

```bash
export HUSKY=0
```

You can re-enable hooks by unsetting the variable or starting a new terminal session.
